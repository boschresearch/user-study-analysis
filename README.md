# User Study Analysis Example
This repository contains the code example from our paper [How to do human evaluation: A brief introduction to user studies in NLP](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324922000535).

## Statistical Analysis Example
The notebook [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) contains R code corresponding to the toy example presented in Section 8.6 of [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1351324922000535) on our introduction to user studies in natural language processing.

It demonstrates the application of a Friedmann test and a Nemenyi post hoc test.
We consider a fictional comparison of three chat bot systems that are compared with respect to user trust ratings.
